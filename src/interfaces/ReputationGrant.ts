/**
 * The "which item was rewarded" pair, as a both-or-neither union.
 *
 * Modelled as a two-branch union rather than two independent optional fields so
 * a half-filled target — `{ targetType }` with no `targetId`, or the reverse —
 * does not compile. The server answers that shape with
 * `400 reputation-grant/invalid-body` on the writes (a shared
 * `bothOrNeitherTarget` refinement on both bodies) and
 * `400 reputation-grant/invalid-filter` on the list, so the union turns a
 * guaranteed round trip into a red squiggle.
 *
 * The empty branch is `?: undefined`, NOT `?: null` — deliberately, and for the
 * same reason `metadata` is not nullable: `grantBodyFields.targetType` is
 * `.optional()` with no `.nullable()`, so an explicit `targetType: null` is
 * rejected. Omit both keys to mean "no target".
 *
 * Building the pair conditionally needs one accommodation: an inline
 * conditional spread of just these two keys widens both to `T | undefined` and
 * then matches neither branch. Either branch the whole argument, or name this
 * type on a helper and spread that:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const target: ReputationGrantTargetFilter = item
 *   ? { targetType: "entity", targetId: item.id }
 *   : {};
 * await listGrants(client, { ...base, ...target });
 * ```
